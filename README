* cp all the files from ./etc/{udev/rules.d,rc.d} to your own /etc, change where necessary, it's important to change the subnet range to your own
* In rc.inet1, add "-R" to the initialization code of dhcpcd to stop it from clobbering resolv.conf which you need for setting up nameservers for your kvm vm sessions
* use 'startvm.sh image.qcow2 tap0' to start a kvm vm session
